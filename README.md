Repository for code used to locate glaciers within a radial distance from volcanoes, and perform analysis on the geometries and dynamics of those glaciers. 

## Processing

### Locate glaciers by volcanoes

The code effectively accomplishes the same as that of [Edwards et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2020.103356), but does so automatically and allows the user to specify the search radius. Besides downloading this repository and the data (see [Data](#data)), the code is fully automated, with optional user inputs.
